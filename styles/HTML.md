HTML Style Guide
======================

Snippets
--------
Use template snippets liberally for HTML segments that will be reused in different templates. Snippets
should be located in a `snippets` directory inside the template root.

Spacing
-------
Always tab with spaces and use 4 spaces per indentation level. If the indentation gets over 4 levels deep,
see if it makes sense to use a snippet, or if you really need all the markup you are using.
