Style guides
============
In order to make our code more readable and maintainable by everyone, we do
our best to use consistent styles on all our projects. Please read through the following guides,
and make sure any contributed code uses the same style. That said, a quick quote from
Python's style guide is in order:
> A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds

If any of these guidelines cause the code to be less readable, just use your best judgement to
make the necessary adjustments to fix the problem. The style guides can be found below.

###[Less/CSS](styles/Less.md)

###[JavaScript](styles/JavaScript.md)

###[HTML](styles/HTML.md)

###[Python](styles/Python.md)

There are also several recommendations we believe should apply universally to retain consistency
throughout our projects, regardless of the language used:
* There should be no extra space at the end of lines. Many editors have a setting to
automatically strip off extra white space when saving.
* There should be one blank line at the end of every file. Again, many editors have an option to
make this happen automatically.
